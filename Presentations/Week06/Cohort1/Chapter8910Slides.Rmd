# Ch. 8 -- Workflow: Projects

PROTIP: Tweak these RStudio settings to ensure reproducibility on any computer!

## Why use RStudio's Projects setup?

- Everything is contained in one directory (scripts, datasets, etc.)

- Keep projects clean and separate

- the `.rproj` filetype opens everything up in the right place in RStudio

# Ch. 9 -- Intro: Wrangle 

![data process](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e3f9e555d0035731c04642ceb58a03fb84b98a7d/4f070/diagrams/data-science-wrangle.png)

If you want to use your data for modeling or visualizing, you're going to have to wrangle it into an R-friendly format first.

In the coming chapters we'll learn how to

- Import your data

- Format it for usability in R

- Transform your data to prepare it for whatever you want to do with it

# Ch. 10 -- Tibbles

### What's a Tibble?

- Tibbles are data frames, but they tweak some older behaviors to make life a little easier.

- Tibbles are one of the unifying features of the tidyverse.

---

## Creating a Tibble

The tibble package is part of the `tidyverse` library, or you can call it up individually with `library(tibble)`

--

`as_tibble()` can turn a regular data frame into a tibble

```{r}
as_tibble(iris)
```

---

## Creating a Tibble

Vectors can also be tibble-ized

```{r}
tibble(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = 1, 
  z = x ^ 2 + y
)
```

---

## Tibble quirks

#### Unlike data frames, tibbles don't ...

- Change data input types (e.g. converting strings to factors)

- Change the names of variables

- Create row names

Also, you can create column names that don't match R syntax by surrounding the name in backticks.

---

## Transposed Tibble = Tribble

- Column headings are defined by formulas (i.e. they start with ~)

- Entries are separated by commas

```{r}
tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~z,
  #--|--|----
  "a", 2, 3.6,
  "b", 1, 8.5
)
```

---

## Tibbles vs. Data Frames

#### When printing ... 

- Tibbles show only the first 10 rows

- Tibbles limit column printing to what fits on a screen

- Each column reports its structure type

But if you ever need to print more than the initial view shows, you can customize the output.

---

## Tibbles vs. Data Frames

#### When subsetting ...

- Tibbles never do partial matching, and they will generate a warning if the column you are trying to access does not exist.

- `[[` can extract by name or position

- `$` only extracts by name

```{r}
df <- tibble(
  x = runif(5),
  y = rnorm(5)
)

# Extract by name
df$x
df[["x"]]
```

---

## Tibbles vs. Data Frames

#### When subsetting ...

```{r}
df <- tibble(
  x = runif(5),
  y = rnorm(5)
)

# Extract by position
df[[1]]
```

** NOTE :To use these in a pipe, youâ€™ll need to use the special placeholder `.`: **

```{r}
df %>% .$x

df %>% .[["x"]]
```

---

## Tibbles vs. Data Frames

```{r}
df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
tibbledf <- as_tibble(df)

df

tibbledf
```

---

## Tibbles vs. Data Frames

```{r}
df$x

tibbledf$x

df[, "xyz"]

tibbledf[, "xyz"]
```

---

## Tibbles vs. Data Frames

```{r}
df[, c("abc", "xyz")]

tibbledf[, c("abc", "xyz")]
```
