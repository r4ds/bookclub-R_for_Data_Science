## Welcome!

We'll be covering a different chapter of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund every Friday at 8 p.m. Eastern/5 p.m. Pacific.

Sessions will be recorded if you can't make it live every week.

Are you up for presenting one week? Let me know!

## What we'll learn

> "You'll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most 
> useful structure, transform it, visualize it and model it.

...

> "Just as a chemist learns to clean test tubes and stock a lab, 
> you'll learn how to clean data and draw plots --- and many other 
> things besides."

## The 80-20 Rule

> "You can tackle about 80% of every project using the tools that
> you'll learn in this book, but you'll need other tools to tackle the
> remaining 20%."

[*-- Wickham & Grolemund, Ch. 1.1*]{style="float:right"}

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

That final 20% will vary by project, the data you're exploring and the questions you're hoping to answer.

## A Wise Word from the Authors

> "While it's tempting to skip the exercises, there's no better
> way to learn than practicing on real problems."

Fortunately, there's someone who's run through this book before and created a sort of [answer key](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/).

(But seriously  ... you'll learn more if you at least try to solve it on your own first)

## What You Need for this Book Club

1. [Install R](https://cloud.r-project.org/)

2. [Install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

3. Open RStudio and install the Tidyverse package by typing or pasting the following in the console (bottom-left box)

`install.packages("tidyverse")`

4. Install these other packages the book uses as examples by typing or pasting the following in the console

## See you next week!

We'll be tackling **Data Visualization**

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
    geom_point(aes(colour = drv)) +
    geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```
