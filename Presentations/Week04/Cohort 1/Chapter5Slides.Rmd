## Introduction 

### Data transformation helps you get the data in exactly the right form you need. 

--

- create new variables
- create summaries
- rename variables
- reorder observations
- ...and more!

--

### This chapter uses the `nycflights13` `r emo::ji('package')`

- Data set includes 336,776 flights that departed from New York City in 2013 
- US Bureau of Transportation Statistics

---

## Introduction

```{r}
flights
```




---

## Introduction

```{r}
head(flights, 4)
```

--

.pull-left[
- `int`: integers 
- `dbl`: doubles, or real numbers
- `chr`: character vectors, or strings 
- `dttm`: date-times (a date + a time)

]

--

.pull-right[
- `lgl`: logical, vectors with only TRUE or FALSE
- `fctr`: factors, categorical variables
- `date`: dates
]

---

## Introduction

### **dplyr** basics

- Pick observations by their values (`filter()`).
- Reorder the rows (`arrange()`).
- Pick variables by their names (`select()`).
- Create new variables with functions of existing variables (`mutate()`).
- Collapse many values down to a single summary (`summarise()`).
--

- **+** `group_by()` which gets the above functions to operate group-by-group rather than on the entire dataset

### How do they work?

1. First argument is data frame
2. Other arguments describe what to do with the data frame
3. Result is a new data frame!


---

## Filter rows with `filter()`

Lets you subset observations based on their values.

--

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

---

### Comparisons

R provides the standard suite of comparison operators:
- `>`
- `>=`
- `<`
- `<=`
- `!=` (not equal)
- `==` (equal)

---

### Logical operators

- `&` is "and"
- `|` is "or"
- `!` is "not"

.center[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height=400}
knitr::include_graphics('https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/01f4b6d39d2be8269740a3ad7946faa79f7243cf/8369a/diagrams/transform-logical.png')
```
]

---

### Missing values

- Missing values a.k.a. `NA`s a.k.a. "not availables" represent an unknown value

--

- They are contagious! `r emo::ji('microbe')` ...meaning almost any operation involving an unknown value will also be unknown 


--

### Also important because...

`filter()` only includes rows where the condition is `TRUE` (i.e. it includes both `FALSE` and `NA` values)

--

If you want to preserve missing values you must ask for them explicitly:
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```

---

### Ex: Find all flights that were operated by United, American, or Delta

```{r, eval=TRUE, include = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
head(flights, 2)
```

--

```{r, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
unique(flights$carrier)
```

--

```{r, eval=FALSE, include = TRUE}
# option 1
flights %>% filter(carrier = "UA" | "AA" | "DL")

# option 2
flights %>% filter(carrier == "UA" | "AA" | "DL")

# option 3
flights %>% filter(carrier == "UA" | carrier == "AA" | carrier == "DL")

# option 4
flights %>% filter(carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"))
```

---

#### Ex: Find all flights that were operated by United, American, or Delta

```{r, eval = FALSE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
flights %>% filter(carrier = "UA" | "AA" | "DL")
```
> Error: Problem with `filter()` input `..1`. x Input `..1` is named. ℹ This usually means that you've used `=` instead of `==`. ℹ Did you mean `carrier == "UA" | "AA" | "DL"`?

---
#### Ex: Find all flights that were operated by United, American, or Delta

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE, warning=TRUE, message=TRUE}
flights %>% filter(carrier == "UA" | "AA" | "DL")
```
> Error: Problem with `filter()` input `..1`. x operations are possible only for numeric, logical or complex types ℹ Input `..1` is `carrier == "UA" | "AA" | "DL"`.

```

---

## Arrange rows with `arrange()`

### Changes the order of the rows
Takes a data frame and orders it by a set of column names (or more complicated expressions)

--

- orders a column in ascending order by default
- `desc()` can be used to reorder a column in `desc`ending order
--

- **Note:** missing values (`NA`s) are always sorted at the end

---

### Ex: Sort flights to find the most delayed flights. Find the flights that left earliest.

```{r}
flights
```

---

#### Sort flights to find the most delayed flights
```{r eval=FALSE}
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay)),3)
```
--
#### Find the flights that left earliest
```{r eval=FALSE}
arrange(flights, dep_delay)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(arrange(flights, dep_delay),3)
```

---

## Select columns with `select()`

Sometimes we get data sets that have hundreds or thousands of variables `r emo::ji('grimacing')`

--

`select()` gives us a way to narrow down to only those variables we're interested in! `r emo::ji('tada')`

--

#### Helper functions include
- `starts_with("abc")`: matches names that begin with “abc”.
- `ends_with("xyz")`: matches names that end with “xyz”.
- `contains("ijk")`: matches names that contain “ijk”.
- `matches("(.)\\1")`: selects variables that match a regular expression. This one matches any variables that contain repeated characters (more in **Chapter 14: Strings**)
- `num_range("x", 1:3)`: matches x1, x2 and x3.
--

- `r emo::ji("star")` `everything()`: useful when you want to move a few variables to the start of the data frame

---

### Ex: Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select `dep_time`, `dep_delay`, `arr_time`, and `arr_delay` from flights.

```{r}
flights
```

---

## Not quite! Why?

---

## Add new variables with `mutate()`

Helps you add new columns that are functions of existing columns

--

- always adds columns at the end of your dataset
--

- if you want to only keep the new variables, you can use `transmute()`

---

### Add new variables with `mutate()`

.pull-left[
Can be used with _arithmetic operators_
- `+`
- `-`
- `*`
- `/`
- `^`
- `sum()`
]

--

.pull-right[

_modular arithmetic_
- `%/%` (integer division)
- `%%` (remainder)
- `log()`
- `log2()`
- `log10()`
]

--

.pull-left[

- _logical comparisons_: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`
- _offsets_: `lead()` and `lag()`
- _ranking_: `min_rank()`, `row_number()`, `dense_rank()`, and more!
]

---

## Grouped summaries with `summarize()`

Collapses a data frame into a single row and more useful when combined with `group_by()`

--

Arguably **most** useful when used with the pipe `%>%` operator

--

Go from this:
```{r eval=FALSE}
by_dest <- group_by(flights, dest)
delay <- summarize(by_dest, count = n(),
                   dis = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
                   delay = mean(arr_del, na.rm = TRUE))
```

--
To this! `r emo::ji('tada')`
```{r eval=FALSE}
flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarize(by_dest, count = n(),
            dis = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
            delay = mean(arr_del, na.rm = TRUE))
```

#### Spot the differences!

---

## Grouped mutate (and filters)

Most useful in combination with `summarize()`

--

For example:

```{r}
popular_dests <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  filter(n() > 365)
```
